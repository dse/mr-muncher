# Mr. Muncher

Mr. Muncher is a shitty Pac-Man clone for MS-DOS/PC-DOS that I wrote
in Turbo Pascal 3.0 between 1998 and 1992 (I think).  Apparently I
also made some changes for Turbo Pascal 4, which I would use on the
computers at high school.

I was a teenager in a dirt-poor family at the time and my computer was
a donated PCjr.  It had a second floppy drive, 128KB of RAM (woop
woop), and the non-chiclet keyboard.  In lieu of a modem I had
shattered hopes and dreams.

The `version-1` directory contains the first version of the game,
which was a text-mode horror.

The `version-2` directory contains the second version of the game,
which was a CGA shitshow with a bunch of shit that was goofy as fuck.

# License

This game was shareware.  I made $0.00 and got one snail mail response
a few years later, which I never opened out of being a chickenshit
with anxiety.  :-(

This game is [MIT licensed](LICENSE.md) now.

Have fun.  Or don't.
