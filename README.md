Mr. Muncher is a shitty Pac-Man clone for MS-DOS/PC-DOS that I wrote
in Turbo Pascal 3.0 between 1998 and 1992 (I think).  I was a teenager
in a dirt-poor family at the time and my computer was a donated PCjr.
It had a second hard drive, 128KB of RAM (I think), and the
non-chiclet keyboard.

The version-1 directory contains the first version of the game.

I hope to find the second version of the game at some point but it's
not on the 5-1/4-inch floppy I thought it would be on.
